# ⚠️ Multi-Protocol DDoS Simulator (Educational Use Only)

> 🚨 **Disclaimer**: This tool is strictly for educational, ethical, and controlled-environment testing purposes only. Unauthorized use of this script against live systems is **illegal and unethical**. Use it only to test your **own servers or networks** in a lab setup.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Multi-Protocol DDoS Simulation Tool** that demonstrates how different attack vectors (TCP, UDP, and HTTP GET) can flood a target system. It includes:

- ✅ Multi-threaded attack engine
- ✅ Dynamic fake IP generation
- ✅ Proxy support for HTTP floods
- ✅ Customizable protocol selection

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Protocol Support**: TCP, UDP, HTTP (GET)
- **Dynamic IP Spoofing**: Random IPs generated per request
- **Proxy Integration**: Use public proxies for HTTP requests
- **Thread-based Attack**: Simulates multiple attacking clients
- **Live Stats**: See packets/requests sent in real time

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddos-simulator.git
cd ddos-simulator

## Install Dependencies
Only required for HTTP attacks:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests
3. Prepare (Optional) Proxy List
Create a file proxies.txt (optional) with one proxy per line:

makefile
Copy
Edit
1.2.3.4:8080
5.6.7.8:3128
4. Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python ddos_simulator.py
You will be prompted to enter:

✅ Target IP/domain

✅ Target port (e.g., 80)

✅ Protocol type (TCP, UDP, HTTP)

✅ Proxy file path (optional)

💻 Example
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter the target IP/URL: example.com
Enter the target port: 80
Select protocol ['TCP', 'UDP', 'HTTP']: HTTP
Enter proxy list file (or leave blank to skip proxies): proxies.txt
🧪 Testing Suggestions
To test safely:

Use on localhost (127.0.0.1)

Use in virtual environments or containers

Combine with rate-limit detection scripts to understand how systems respond

🔒 Ethical Notice
❗ This project is not intended for real-world usage outside of controlled labs or simulations. Performing unauthorized DDoS attacks is a criminal offense in most countries.

Do NOT use against public or private infrastructure.

Do NOT target systems without explicit permission.

Use this tool only for defensive research and learning.

🛡️ Defending Against DDoS
Want to learn how to defend against these attacks?

Implement rate limiting

Use firewalls and traffic filters

Deploy CDNs and load balancers

Monitor traffic for anomalies

Use services like Cloudflare, Akamai
